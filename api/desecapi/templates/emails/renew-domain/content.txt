Hi there,

You are the owner of the following domain name(s):

{% for domain in domains %}
  * {{ domain.name }}
{% endfor %}

We noticed that the DNS information of the above domain(s) have not
received any updates for more than 6 months.

As explained in our Terms and Conditions (https://desec.io/terms),
we regularly purge inactive domains (as indicated by the absence of
DNS updates). This allows us to free up resources for active deSEC
users.

The above domain name(s) are scheduled for deletion on
{{ deletion_date|date:"F j, Y" }}. If there are no other domains in
your account, we will also delete your account on this date.

To retain your domain name (and account), either change a DNS record
before that date, or click the following link(s):

{% for domain in domains %}
  * {{ domain.name }}
    {{ domain.confirmation_link }}
{% endfor %}

In case you have questions, feel free to contact us!

Stay secure,
The deSEC Team
