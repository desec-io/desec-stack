Hi there,

And welcome to the deSEC dynDNS service! I'm Nils, CTO of deSEC.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hestitate
to contact me.

To get started using your new dynDNS domain {{ domain }},
please configure your device (or any other dynDNS client) to use
the following credentials:

  url:      {{ url }}
  username: {{ username }}
  password: {{ password }}

Alternatively, you can update your dynDNS IP record by visiting 
this page:

  https://update.dedyn.io/update?username={{ username }}&password={{ password }}

If your router does not support dynDNS, you might want to
bookmark this URL.

You can use our website to see if everything works as expected:

  https://dedyn.io/check?{{ domain }}#{{ password }}

We know there is always room for improvement, so please shoot me
an email if we can do anything better.

Thanks for using deSEC, we hope you do enjoy your DNSSEC-enabled
dynDNS.

Stay secure,
Nils
