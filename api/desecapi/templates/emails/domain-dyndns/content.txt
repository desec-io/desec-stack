Hi there,

And welcome to the deSEC dynDNS service! I'm Nils, CTO of deSEC.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hestitate
to contact me.

Note: If you find that your domain does not work, it may be
because a captcha needs to be solved first. In this case, please
double-check your mailbox for a separate email with captcha
instructions. Don't forget your spam folder, especially when
using a gmail address!

To get started using your new dynDNS domain {{ domain }},
please configure your device (or any other dynDNS client) to use
the following credentials:

  url:      {{ url }}
  username: {{ username }}
  password: {{ password }}

Alternatively, you can update your dynDNS IP record by visiting 
this page:

  https://update.dedyn.io/update?username={{ username }}&password={{ password }}

If your router does not support dynDNS, you might want to
bookmark this URL.

You can use our website to see if everything works as expected:

  https://desec.io/#!/en/tools/dyndns-check?domain={{ domain }}

We know there is always room for improvement, so please shoot me
an email if we can do anything better.

Thanks for using deSEC, we hope you do enjoy your DNSSEC-enabled
dynDNS.

Stay secure,
Nils
