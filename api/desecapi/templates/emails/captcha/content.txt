Hello,

Your activity on the deSEC DNS service (e.g. dedyn.io) looks
suspiciously similar to the one of bots. As mass registrations
by bots have been a problem for us in the past, we need to
ask you to prove you are not a bot by solving a CAPTCHA. Sorry
to bother you with that!

Please go to

  {{url}}

and unlock your account for future use. Until unlocked, your
account will be kept in read-only mode, that is, you won't be able
to register any new domains or update IP addresses (or any other
records). Accounts that are not unlocked are subject to deletion
after two weeks.

If you need mass registrations for a legit purpose, please
contact us directly. Just reply to this email, we will be happy
to get in touch with you.

As we use Google Recaptcha for our CAPTCHA, we recommend using
your browser's anonymous mode to solve it.

Stay secure,
Nils
