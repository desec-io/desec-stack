Domain Management
-----------------

Domain management is done through the ``/api/v1/domains/`` endpoint.  The
following sections describe how to create, list, modify, and delete domains
using JSON objects.  The structure of the JSON objects is detailed in the next
section.


.. _`domain object`:

Domain Field Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A JSON object representing a domain has the following structure::

    {
        "created": "2018-09-18T16:36:16.510368Z",
        "name": "example.com",
        "keys": [
            {
                "dnskey": "257 3 13 WFRl60...",
                "ds": [
                    "6006 13 1 8581e9...",
                    "6006 13 2 f34b75...",
                    "6006 13 3 dfb325...",
                    "6006 13 4 2fdcf8..."
                ],
                "flags": 257,
                "keytype": "csk"
            },
            ...
        ],
        "published": "2018-09-18T17:21:38.348112Z"
    }

Field details:

``created``
    :Access mode: read-only

    Timestamp of domain creation, in ISO 8601 format (e.g.
    ``2013-01-29T12:34:56.000000Z``).

``keys``
    :Access mode: read-only

    Array with DNSSEC key information.  Each entry contains ``DNSKEY`` and
    ``DS`` record contents (the latter being computed from the former), and
    some extra information.  For delegation of DNSSEC-secured domains, the
    parent domain needs to publish these ``DS`` records.  (This usually
    involves telling your registrar/registry about those records, and they
    will publish them for you.)

    Notes:

    - Newly created domains are assigned a key after a short while (usually
      around one minute).  Until then, this field is empty.

    - The contents of this field are generated from PowerDNS' ``cryptokeys``
      endpoint, see https://doc.powerdns.com/md/httpapi/api_spec/#cryptokeys.
      We look at each active ``cryptokey_resource`` (``active`` is true) and
      then use the ``dnskey``, ``ds``, ``flags``, and ``keytype`` fields.

``name``
    :Access mode: read, write-once (upon domain creation)

    Domain name.  Restrictions on what is a valid domain name apply on a
    per-user basis.  In general, a domain name consists of alphanumeric
    characters as well as hyphens ``-`` and underscores ``_`` (except at the
    beginning of the name).  The maximum length is 191.

``published``
    :Access mode: read-only

    Timestamp of when the domain's DNS records have last been published,
    in ISO 8601 format (e.g. ``2013-01-29T12:34:56.000000Z``).

    As we publish record modifications immediately, this indicates the
    point in time of the last successful write request to a domain's
    ``rrsets/`` endpoint.  Exception: If the user account is locked, record
    changes are queued and not published immediately. In this case, the
    ``published`` field is not updated.


Creating a Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new domain, issue a ``POST`` request to the ``/api/v1/domains/``
endpoint, like this::

    http POST \
        https://desec.io/api/v1/domains/ \
        Authorization:"Token {token}" \
        name:='"example.com"'

Only the ``name`` field is mandatory.

Upon success, the response status code will be ``201 Created``, with the
domain object contained in the response body.  ``400 Bad Request`` is returned
if the request contained malformed data.  If the object could not be
created although the request was wellformed, the API responds with ``403
Forbidden`` if the maximum number of domains for this user has been reached,
and with ``409 Conflict`` otherwise.  This can happen, for example, if there
already is a domain with the same name or if the domain name is considered
invalid for policy reasons.

Restrictions on what is a valid domain name apply on a per-user basis.  The
response body *may* provide further, human-readable information on the policy
violation that occurred.


Listing Domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/api/v1/domains/`` endpoint reponds to ``GET`` requests with an array of
`domain object`_\ s. For example, you may issue the following command::

    http GET \
        https://desec.io/api/v1/domains/ \
        Authorization:"Token {token}"

to retrieve an overview of the domains you own.

The response status code is ``200 OK``.  This is true also if you do not own
any domains; in this case, the response body will be an empty JSON array.


Retrieving a Specific Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve a domain with a specific name, issue a ``GET`` request with the
``name`` appended to the ``domains/`` endpoint, like this::

    http GET \
        https://desec.io/api/v1/domains/{name}/ \
        Authorization:"Token {token}"

This will return only one domain (i.e., the response is not a JSON array).

If you own a domain with that name, the API responds with ``200 OK`` and
returns the domain object in the reponse body.  Otherwise, the return status
code is ``404 Not Found``.


Deleting a Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a domain, send a ``DELETE`` request to the endpoint representing the
domain.  Upon success or if the domain did not exist or was not yours in the
first place, the response status code is ``204 No Content``.
