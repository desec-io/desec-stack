                    actually do appreciate recurring donations.

                    Many employers <b>double donations</b> initiated by their employees. Donations often happen through
                    dedicated facilitation platforms such as

                  <p>
                    Make sure to <b>check with your company</b> if you're eligible for a co-donation, and double the
                    impact!

              <strong>Based in Europe?</strong> You almost certainly can donate via direct debit or bank transfer (you
              only need your IBAN). <strong>No fees</strong> will be subtracted, so you can do more good!

              deSEC e.V. is registered as a charitable organization in Germany. If you pay taxes here, your donation is
              tax-deductible, and we're happy to provide you with a donation receipt for that purpose. Note that for

              Reliable operation of our free DNS service incurs significant cost (several thousand euros each month!),
              both for the serious technical infrastructure that is required as well as for staff. Your donation is
              used to cover these expenses and ensures our service's smooth operation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also need your donation to support the future development of our services to make the Internet more
              secure. If you would like to contribute to this, please support us with your donation and encourage
              others to do alike.
            </p>

              Your donation also gives you a way to say “Thanks!”. If you are excited about our free community service,
              please consider expressing your gratitude with a small (or large) gift.
